I searched some examples on google before creating the gallery, and watched two tutorial videos about how to creat the gallery. I realized the most difficult part for me is the JS, therefore I decided to review our class slides on Brightspace.

The first step was to creat a basic frame in HTML, then styled it through CSS. For realizing a responsive website, I applied grid to three viewpoints.

Then I met the first challenge: add images in JS. even though I can understand the content in the class, it is hard for me to apply the knowlege on this assignment. I spent half day on youtube and google then i found a easy way to add image : create an element in JS and well utilize "for loop".

However all images can not fit the screen well, that's because i forgot to set the max width for each pictures in CSS. So, for presenting a perfect visual effect, we should well combine the CSS and JS.

The transform and trnasition are the best and most effctive way to make the website active; by using :hover, I accomplised the animation of each picture.

After finising these basic function, I can not move forward, because I had no idea about how to realize the overlay fuction when users click on the picture. The PA anton  told me to creat an overlay div in HTML, then add eventlistener to all images and when the function "click" is excuted,let class "overlay" show on the screen and show the image through innerHTML.

It is easy to add keydown function in the Js, which based on the rokect excerise.


During this whole process, I found that the logic and combination of the knowledge what we have learned are the biggest challenge for me. all in class exercise and assignments should be well analyzed. I need to spend more time practicing the JS. In addition, HTML and CSS are the basic of a website, i can not ignore their importance.
